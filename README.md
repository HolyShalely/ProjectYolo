# Welcome to Project Yolo

It's going to be bold. It's going to be daring. It might even be a little bit sexy. This is the kind of project you make when you-only-live-once. Buckle up.

## Collaborating

The toughest part about this jam (I think) is going to be collaborating across distance and time. I've tried to get the whole back-end set up, so that we can all just jump in and start working. We're going to be using two tools to collaborate:

* GitHub: It's the website you're on right now (and we'll be using the page you're on now). It runs on a program called '[git](https://git-scm.com/)' that is basically just advanced version control. *All of our game files (code, art, levels, etc.) will live here*, and it will serve as a central place to push updates you make and to pull updates that other people make. More on that later.
* Discord: All of our communication should go through here. No need to F* with text, Whatsapp, or anything else. [Go to the server.](https://discord.gg/U2nmZJV)

Note: If anyone has suggestions about how to organize better, make them. That's part of collaborating, too.

## Getting Started

1. Install Unreal Engine 4

This is the engine we're going to be using. You can install it [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/?sessionInvalidated=true). Make sure to install version **4.24**. Tip: It will run faster if you install it on a solid state drive, if you have one, but it will take up a huge chunk of that drive (~40-50GB).

2. Install GitHub for Desktop

This is a desktop client for GitHub that will make it easier for you to pull/push game changes. You can install it [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

3. Clone the project repository to your local computer

You'll use the GitHub desktop program for this. Test: By this point, you should have everything you need to start developing. Confirm by opening 

4. *Bonus*: Install Steam and keep it running in the background

In case we want to add online multiplayer functionality (not necessarily needed), Steam is the best platform to facilitate that. In particular, Steam's servers let you play cross-platform, so we could test games between PC's and Mac's at the same time.
